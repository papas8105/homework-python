This is proposal for creating homeworks in python. 
You could write more questions, compile the .py file so that the student cannot open the file to see the answers (python -m py_compile homework-1.py).
I also give a way to give a final grading 3 character pattern based on the student's name (in order not to cheat between each other), 
of course this is very absurd you could find more secure ways.
