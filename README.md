This is a proposal for creating homeworks in python. 
You could write more questions, compile the .py file so that the student cannot open the file to see the answers (python3 -m py_compile homework-1.py).
I also give a way to create a final grading 3 character pattern (to be sent to the tutor's email) based on the student's name (in order not to cheat from one another), of course you could change the pattern in order to create your 'final grade characters' algorithm.
