This is a proposal for creating homeworks in python. 
You could write more questions, compile the .py file so that the student cannot open the file to see the answers (python3 -m py_compile homework-1.py).
I also give a way to give a final grading 3 character pattern (to be sent to the tutor's email) based on the student's name (in order not to cheat between each other), 
of course this is very absurd you could find more secure ways.
